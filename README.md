# Data-Cleaning-Exercise
This codebase utilises python pandas to clean a dataset

Summary:
-


Although, this cleaning process was for a very small dataset,
these methods of cleaning can also be applied for a much larger 
data set.

However, its worth noting that when working with a very large dataset,
some of the issues with a dataset that requires cleaning, may not be 
so obvious. 

To tackle this issue, an exploratory data analysis(EDA)
can be done to spot some of the issues with the 
dataset. Following an EDA, the dataset can be cleaned
