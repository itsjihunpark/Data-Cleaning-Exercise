# Data-Cleaning-Exercise
This codebase utilises python pandas to clean a dataset

Summary:
-


Although, this cleaning process was for a very small dataset-
this process has taught me some of the methods to clean a dataset
to be more standardised which can be applied when cleaning dataset 
which has tens of thousands rows of data.

However, its worth noting that when working with a very large dataset,
some of the issues with the dataset that needs to be cleaned may not be 
as obvious. 

To tackle this issue, exploratory data analysis will need to be done to 
spot some of the issues with the dataset. Only after that, can the dataset
can be cleaned
