# Data-Cleaning-Exercise
This codebase utilises python pandas to clean a dataset

Summary:
-


Although, this cleaning process was for a very small dataset-
these methods of cleaning can also be applied for a much larger 
data set.

However, its worth noting that when working with a very large dataset,
some of the issues with a dataset that requires cleaning, may not be 
so obvious. 

To tackle this issue, exploratory data analysis will need to be done to 
spot some of the issues with the dataset. Only after that, can the dataset
can be cleaned
